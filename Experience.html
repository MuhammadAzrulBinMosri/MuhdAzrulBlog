              <h1>As a Cashier</h1>
              <p>After I finished my schooling, I decided to work at one of the pump petrol stations which is Petronas. There, I was assigned as a cashier and taught how to operate a money machine properly and how to interact with customers nicely. With that, I was able to learn how to communicate well and handle the job carefully and responsibly.</p>

              <h1>Working in a Factory</h1>
              <p>I decided to work in one of the chip factories during the semester break to supplement my income. There, I was taught how to handle heavy work such as peeling potato skins, wrapping chips and more. I have to work in a hot place and there is only a fan as a cooler but I feel happy working there because I have been taught how to work in groups well so as to be able to complete the whole work on time.</p>

              <h1>Enter Computer Class</h1>
              <p>During the semester break, I took the opportunity to enter a computer class at a reasonable fee price. There, I was taught a lot of computer science such as how to use Words, Power Point, Excel and more. Although, I already know how to use it will but there is much more I do not know and much more to learn. I entered the class for a month and gained a lot of knowledge. As a result, I was able to master the skills of using a computer well and did not regret entering the class.</p>

              <h1>Practical Work</h1>
              <p>When I was in my last semester, I had to find a job that could accept me to do practicals. It was quite difficult to find a place and finally I was able to even do my practical at one of the libraries near my house. There, I was taught many things and taught how to handle the books or materials that were there. There too, I was given a lot of exposure and I was able to see it face to face and it made me more understanding to handle the work.</p>
