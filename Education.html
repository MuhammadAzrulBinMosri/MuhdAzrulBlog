          <h3>Prasekolah JAIS Daerah Kuala Langat</h3>
          <p>When I was 5 years old, I was admitted to the preschool to get an earlier lesson. My mom and dad send me every 8am. There, I was taught many things about basic learning for children such as spelling, writing and so on. There I was also taught to be independent and work on my own. I went to school there until I was 6 years old and finished my studies with a school certificate.</p>

          <h3>Sekolah Kebangsaan Kanchong Darat (SKKD).</h3>
          <p>When my age increased to 7 years old, I was admitted to primary school in my place. The school is close to the house which is only 1 km away. there, I was taught more than preschool. The school teaches many and in-depth subjects such as mathematics, language learning, science and so on. I finished my studies at the school when I was 12 years old and got excellent and satisfactory UPSR results. I got 4A 1B.</p>

          <h3>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Telok Datok (SMKTD)</h3>
          <p>When i was 13 years old i.e. form 1, I got an offer to a high school which is located a little far from my house which measures 20 km. At that school I was able to enter the dormitory because I had a scholarship from Yayasan Selangor. There, I gained a lot of experience with friends, seniors and teachers. I was taught how to live as a student such as following a set schedule, how to study effectively and study with friends, play sports and so on. At that school, I finished my schooling until I was in Form 5. During PT3, I got a result of 8A 3B and my SPM which is estimated to be all the subjects I passed.</p>

          <h3>Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM)</h3>
          <p>After I finished school, I got an offer to continue studying at a higher level at UiTM when I was 18 years old. I got an offer to study in the field of information management at UiTM Rembau Campus, Negeri Sembilan. There, I studied for 2 years and 6 months. At first, I did not know what my field was until I was given exposure by UiTM and lecturers about the field I took. Once I found out, there are many branches that can be done in the field. I have finished my diploma period with a certificate roll and finished it with excellent results.</p>
